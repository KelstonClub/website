<h1>Beginners</h1>

<h2>Possible Resources</h2>

<h3>The Mu Editor</h3>

<b><a href="https://codewith.mu">https://codewith.mu</a></b>

<p>This is the editor we recommend for beginners: it's designed for educational purposes, especially in a classroom or coding club situation, and it
comes with Python and some useful tools installed.

<h3>The Official Python tutorial</h3>

<b><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/</a></b>

<p>This is part of the official Python documentation and is in no way geared for younger readers. However, some people take to its methodical approach, and some parts of it may be useful even when the whole isn't.


<h3>Let's Learn Python</h3>
<b><a href="http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/">http://www.letslearnpython.com/learn/</a></b>

<p>This is (apparently) the tutorial used in the young coders days at the main Python conference in the States


<h3>Coding Club Cards</h3>
<b><a href="http://codingclub.co.uk/codecards/CC-CodeCards.pdf">http://codingclub.co.uk/codecards/CC-CodeCards.pdf</a></b>

<p>This is the PDF version of a little booklet which an educator in Cambridge has helpfully made available. It's a very useful quick guide to each of the main elements of Python.


<h3>Al Sweigart's books</h3>
<b><a href="https://inventwithpython.com/">https://inventwithpython.com/</a></b>

<p>These books are all available free as PDF or to buy. They're aimed broadly at younger/beginner coders and they're trying to engage with projects which would interest people.


<h3>Raspberry Pi projects</h3>
<b><a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en">https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en</a></b>

<p>Altho' the Raspberry Pi Foundation has its roots in the RPi computer, the foundation's remit is much wider, covering all sorts of educational elements of coding. They have resources on coding in Python, using HTML, Scratch, even Android apps.


<h3>EduBlocks</h3>
<b><a href="https://edublocks.org/">https://edublocks.org/</a></b>

<p>This is a sort of bridge between Scratch (block-based coding) and Python: you move the blocks as you would in Scratch and it generates the corresponding Python. It's devised and developed by a (now) 15-year-old call Josh based up in Preston. He's very friendly and willing to help.
